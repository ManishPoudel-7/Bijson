# Bijson Assignment

This is a Node.js web scraper built using Express, Axios, and Cheerio. The app takes an SSC result link and extracts the candidate's personal details.

## ✅ Features
- Fetches:
  - Name, Roll Number
  - Venue, Exam Date & Time
  - Subject
- Works perfectly on **local system**

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Section-wise marks (attempted, correct, etc.) couldn’t be extracted reliably
- Tried multiple approaches and took help, but couldn't resolve due to complex DOM

## 🚀 Deployment
- First time using **Render**
- App loads but scraping fails on deployed version
- Works fully **locally**

- ## 🌐 Live Preview (Render)

> ⚠️ Note: This was my first time deploying on Render. The site is live, but scraping doesn't work due to external request issues. It works perfectly on the local system.
